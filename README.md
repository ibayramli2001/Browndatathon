# Browndatathon
In this project, we try to investigate the variance of assessed-value vs. price relationship in the state of Pennsylvania. We found some interesting patterns in the geographic distribution of house prices across the state. See BROWN_DATATHON.pdf for the final findings of this project which won the honorable mention in Brown Datathon, 2019.
